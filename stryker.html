                    I gained valuable experience in safety, testing, and attention to detail in developing critical technologies. At AbbVie, I performed HVAC system analysis and utilized AutoCAD for design tasks. My work at Pfizer involved revising P&ID drawings and assisting with equipment re-qualification. Additionally, in my
