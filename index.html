                            This was a semester-long team-based project based on the broad prompt for solving an issue.  Our team decided to focus this prompt on healthcare as most members were interested in the field and felt we could create a product that helps a user group. We decided to focus on wheelchair transfer after doing extensive research on potential user groups and target issues. Our solution was a purely mechanical height-adjustable wheelchair that used a crank shaft and a scissor lift to adjust the height that the user is sitting at to improve the ease of wheelchair transfer. Throughout the project, I worked on research, concept generation, design of the device, and 3D modeling (Autodesk Inventor). I also aided in the construction of the physical prototype and helped the other team members with their tasks once mine were completed. Below are some pictures from throughout the design process.

                        This project was the culmination of a semester-long robotics course I took while studying at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Madrid, Spain. The controller was programmed in C using Webots robot simulation software. The objective of the project was to design a controller for the Pioneer II robot that allows it to explore multiple different worlds with different conditions and find people in distress in an environment that emulates a disaster. To do this, the robot was required to drive from one side of the environment to the other, find the people (marked by green cylinders), and return to the starting line in a given period of time. The sensors that were used for this controller were the compass, front and spherical cameras, GPS, and an array of distance sensors. Below is a video of the robot controller in action in one of the environments that it was tested in.

                            This project won 1st Place in Purdue's Design & Innovation challenge in December 2022. I had the pleasure of working on a multidisciplinary team of women devoted to developing a solution for managing debilitating menstrual pain. As the only person on the team that was unable to experience menstrual pain at all, I ensured that I remained respectful and tried to listen as much as I could to their experiences as well as the experiences of people that I interviewed. On the team, I aided in the research, brainstorming, and design of the product. Our final design was a heated garment that provides comfort and targetted relief to one of the most common pain areas. Below are some pictures from throughout the design process.
